### Analysis
###### Clothing Store Website

##### A hypothetical client interested in this project will be someone interested in starting/opening their clothing brand online through a website. This project aims to design a website that gives an in-depth description of products you'd want to sell. Make it accessible and easy to make purchases and make wishlists, and carts with your favourite items. It includes a title, excerpt, description and a big product image with a caption to describe the image illustration. Any product characteristics can be specified by adding colour options, size options, and prices. More than one image can be added to advertise the product.

##### I would like this website to not include a lot of one-to-many, relations because I belive that it makes the functionaity of the site feel messy. All the diffferent site tabs opening up are also overwhelming to browse through.

##### A potential Sitemap for this project would look similar to this project by [Fatimah Alamoudi](https://medium.com/@fatimahalamoudi)

* Two re-usable components in the project are the image and product components. The same format is used to every item listed in the project.
